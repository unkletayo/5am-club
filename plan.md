You are a senior frontend engineer and creative technologist tasked with building a single-page, animated, scroll-driven web experience based on Robin Sharma's "The 5 AM Club."

I have provided you with the following Markdown documents inside the docs folder:

1. PRD.md — defines the product requirements and success criteria
2. Developer_Execution_Prompt.md — detailed instructions on how to execute
3. Design_System.md — colors, typography, spacing, motion tokens, and interaction rules
4. Motion_Storyboard.md — scroll-driven motion storyboard with emotional states per section
5. Animation_Spec.md — GSAP/Framer Motion specifications

Your task is to:

- Read and understand all documents thoroughly before starting
- Plan the project section by section (HTML structure, React components if using React, animation timeline, responsive layout)
- Implement animations exactly according to the storyboard and spec
- Strictly follow the design system
- Provide clean, modular, production-ready code with comments
- Suggest performance optimizations and handle reduced-motion preferences

Before starting coding, first produce:

1. A high-level architecture of components/sections
2. A section-by-section implementation plan
3. Animation sequencing mapped to each section

Wait for approval on the plan before producing the code.

Do not start coding until the plan is approved.
