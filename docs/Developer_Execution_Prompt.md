Below is a **clean, senior-level Markdown formatting**, **properly split into two documents**, ready to drop directly into your `docs/` folder:

* `Developer_Execution_Prompt.md`
* `Design_System.md`

No fluff, no ambiguity, no junior structure.

# 📄 Developer_Execution_Prompt.md

## Role

You are a **senior frontend engineer and creative technologist** with experience building **award-level, animation-driven storytelling websites** (Awwwards-style).

You think in terms of:

* Narrative
* Motion systems
* Performance
* Restraint

You are implementing a **single-page, scroll-driven, immersive web experience** based on *The 5 AM Club* by Robin Sharma.

Your output must feel like it was built by someone who:

* Understands the book deeply
* Understands modern web animation
* Has strong design taste

---

## Objective

Build a **responsive, cinematic, animated webpage** that communicates:

* The philosophy behind waking up at 5 AM
* The 20/20/20 Formula
* The Four Interior Empires
* Habit formation through struggle
* Practical, real-life application

> This is **not** a summary site.
> It is a **guided experience**.

---

## Non-Negotiable Quality Bar

* Comparable to **Awwwards Honorable Mention** quality
* No slide-deck layouts
* No generic animations
* No excessive motion without meaning

If a design or animation does **not** teach, reinforce, or clarify — **remove it**.

---

## Execution Rules

* **Think first, code second**
* Propose **architecture, section flow, and animation intent** before implementation
* **Animation serves meaning**
* Motion must reflect:

  * Transformation
  * Resistance
  * Clarity
  * Progression
* **Senior-level restraint**

  * Fewer animations, executed perfectly
* **Performance-aware**

  * 60fps target
  * Minimal layout thrashing

---

## Deliverables

* Full source code

  * React + modern CSS **or** Vanilla JS acceptable
* Clear file structure
* Commented animation logic
* Explanation of tech stack choices
* Notes for future customization

## Section-by-Section Implementation Guidance

### 1. Hero / Opening

**Intent:** Emotional hook
**Concept:** Chaos → calm

**Visual Direction:**

* Large typography
* Minimal copy
* Slow, confident pacing

**Animation:**

* Subtle parallax
* Text fade/slide with refined easing

---

### 2. Problem Space

**Intent:** Show distraction and noise

**Animation:**

* Slightly chaotic motion
* Overlapping layers resolving into order

---

### 3. Philosophy of 5 AM

**Intent:** Cognitive leverage and solitude

**Animation:**

* Space opens up
* Reduced motion
* Increased whitespace

---

### 4. The 20/20/20 Formula

**Intent:** Structure and momentum

**Animation:**

* Three sequential panels
* Each activates on scroll
* Clear separation within a unified system

---

### 5. The Four Interior Empires

**Intent:** Balance and wholeness

**Animation:**

* Interactive quadrant or orbiting system
* Subtle hover feedback

---

### 6. Habit Installation Protocol

**Intent:** Difficulty and transformation

**Animation:**

* Friction-based transitions
* Heavier easing
* Visual resistance before clarity

---

### 7. Real-Life Application

**Intent:** Grounded practicality

**Animation:**

* Minimal
* Calm
* Confidence through stillness

---

### 8. Closing Challenge

**Intent:** Ownership and action

**Animation:**

* Slow reveal
* Strong typography

---

## Tech Stack Recommendation

Choose and justify:

* **Framework:** React or Next.js
* **Animation:** GSAP (ScrollTrigger) or Framer Motion
* **Styling:** CSS Modules / Tailwind / Vanilla CSS

Explain why your chosen stack best serves:

* Motion
* Performance
* Maintainability

---

## Review Checklist

* Does every animation have intent?
* Is motion reduced on mobile?
* Does content feel lived-in and applied?
* Would a senior designer approve this?
