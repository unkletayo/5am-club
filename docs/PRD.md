# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Title

**The 5 AM Club — Immersive Web Presentation**

---

## Document Purpose

This PRD defines the vision, scope, requirements, and execution plan for building a **premium, animated, responsive storytelling website** that presents the core ideas of _The 5 AM Club_ by Robin Sharma.

The goal is to ensure the final output feels **intentional, senior-designed, and conceptually deep** — not like a beginner presentation or static slide deck.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Traditional presentations (slides, PDFs, static webpages) fail to:

- Communicate **why** _The 5 AM Club_ works emotionally
- Translate philosophy into **lived, practical behavior**
- Hold attention in a world of **short attention spans**

The challenge is to transform a self-development book into an **experiential digital narrative** that teaches through **motion, pacing, and visual metaphor**.

---

## 2. Product Vision

Create a **single-page, scroll-driven, animated web experience** that:

- Feels comparable to **Awwwards-level storytelling sites**
- Uses **animation as a teaching tool**, not decoration
- Demonstrates **deep understanding and application** of the book
- Leaves the viewer **motivated, clear, and challenged**

> This is not a website _about_ the book.
> This is a website that **embodies** the book.
